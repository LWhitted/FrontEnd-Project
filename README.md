//Primary Necessities for Website://

-search bar that returns recipes/meals

-eventlistener for search-form 

-card appears when meals are searched with images, ingredients and recommended alcoholic drink

-card will have a separate info for recommended alcoholic drink (maybe in a footer area?)

-ingredients for drinks should be included

  --maybe we can create a fun button that they can click when the card appears that says "want a fun drink with this meal? Click here!" and that 
  will generate a random drink 

  --alcoholic drink will be randomized for each meal

-make sure that if a meal does not exist the search-bar has a response ("meal does not exist")
